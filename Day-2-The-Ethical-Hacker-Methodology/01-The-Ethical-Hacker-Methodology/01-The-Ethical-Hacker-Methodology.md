### 2. Scanning and Enumeration:
- That is active where we go out and we take tools such as `Nmap` and `Nessus`
- we take those and we scan actively against the target
- now we are looking for a open ports, vulnerabilities and what return 
- Enumeration- is just looking at items and digging into them to see if we can find anything value
- found a open port, went on google and search about that port exploit
- that is enumeration

### 3. Gaining Access (Exploitation):
- Try to gain access into a machine or into a network 
---
### 4. Maintaining Access: 
- Once we have that access the process
- We also want to maintain the access
- How we gonna connect back..

---
#### 5. Covering Tracks
- You want to delete any logs that you may leave behind 
- You want to delete any kind of a malware that you upload
- You just really want to clean
- Covering tracks is the more hacker way of putting it

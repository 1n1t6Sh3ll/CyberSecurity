1. Reconnaissance:
Active and passive
passive: searching on the Google, LinkedIn , or a twitter profile

You are not going out to companies' websites and not doing anything active against the site

active: tools, scanning, Nessus

---
2. Scanning and Enumeration:
That is active where we go out and we take tools such as Nmap and Nessus
we take those and we scan actively against the target

now we are looking for a open ports, vulnerabilities and what return 

Enumeration- is just looking at items and digging into them to see if we can find anything value

found a open port, went on google and search about that port exploit
that is enumeration

---
3. Gaining Access (Exploitation):
Try to gain access into a machine or into a network 
---
4. Maintaining Access: 
Once we have that access the process
we also want to maintain the access
target shutdown the pc and turned on later on, how we gonna connect back..

5. Covering Tracks
You want to delete any logs that you may leave behind 
you want to delete any kind of a malware that you upload
You just really want to clean

Covering tracks is the more hacker way of putting it

It is al similar, if you do web-app or a network penetration testing

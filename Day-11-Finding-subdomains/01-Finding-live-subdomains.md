##### Hunting Live Subdomains
Now Lets find (working) live subdomains
these both will going to take much time acc to the size of dev domains
If you have vps then good to go 
1. Httpx
-> cat dnsgen_sony.com.txt | httpx -o httpx_subs_sony.com.txt
![[images/Pasted image 20220503200729.png]]

2. Httprobe
-> cat dnsgen_sony.com.txt | httprobe | tee httprobe_sony.com.txt
![[images/Pasted image 20220503201117.png]]

Now combine the both results and sort it 
cat http* | sort -u | tee live_subs_sony.com.txt

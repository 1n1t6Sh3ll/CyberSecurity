### 1. Reconnaissance:

**Active and Passive** -

- **Passive**: searching on Google, LinkedIn, or a Twitter profile
   You are not going out to the company's websites and not doing anything active against the site
- Active: `using tools`, `scanning`, `Nessus`
---
### 2. Scanning and Enumeration:
- That is active where we go out and we take tools such as `Nmap` and `Nessus`.
- We take those and we scan actively against the target.
- Now we are looking for open ports, vulnerabilities and what return.
- Enumeration - is just looking at items and digging into them to see if we can find anything of value.
- Found an open port, went on google and search about that port exploit.
- That is the enumeration.

---
### 3. Gaining Access (Exploitation):
- Try to gain access into a machine or into a network 
---
### 4. Maintaining Access: 
- Once we have that access the process
- We also want to maintain the access
- How are we gonna connect back..

---
#### 5. Covering Tracks
- You want to delete any logs that you may leave behind 
- You want to delete any kind of a malware that you upload
- You just really want to clean
- Covering tracks is the more hacker way of putting it

---
It is all similar if you do web-app or a network penetration testing

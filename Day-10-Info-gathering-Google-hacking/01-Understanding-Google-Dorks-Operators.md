### **Understanding Google Dorks Operators**
Just like in simple math equations, programming code, and other types of algorithms, Google Dorks has several operators that aspiring white hat hackers need to understand. There are far too many to include in this guide, but we will go over some of the most common:
-   intitle – This allows a hacker to search for pages with specific text in their HTML title. So intitle: “login page” will help a hacker scour the web for login pages.
-   allintitle – Similar to the previous operator, but only returns results for pages that meet _all_ of the keyword criteria.
-   inurl – Allows a hacker to search for pages based on the text contained in the URL (i.e., “login.php”).
-   allinurl – Similar to the previous operator, but only returns matches for URLs that meet _all_ the matching criteria.
-   filetype – Helps a hacker narrow down search results to specific files such as PHP, PDF, or TXT file types.
-   ext – Very similar to filetype, but this looks for files based on their file extension.
-   intext – This operator searches the entire content of a given page for keywords supplied by the hacker.
-   allintext – Similar to the previous operator but requires a page to match _all_ of the given keywords.
-   site – Limits the scope of a query to a single website.
